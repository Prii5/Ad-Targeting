This project focused on analyzing advertising strategies to enhance user engagement by predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement.


**Key objectives include:**

Explored relationships between variables through data visualization.

Prepared and preprocessed data (e.g., encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features).

Built a predictive model using logistic regression.

Evaluated model performance to derive actionable insights.



**Model Development**

The project employs logistic regression as the predictive model. The steps include:

_Feature Engineering:_ Encoding categorical variables and selecting relevant features.

_Data Splitting:_ Dividing the data into training and testing sets.

_Feature Scaling:_ Standardizing numerical features for optimal model performance.

_Model Training:_ Fitting a logistic regression model to the training data.

_Model Testing:_ Evaluating the model on test data.

_Performance Evaluation:_ Using metrics to assess how well the model predicts ad clicks.


**Evaluation Metrics**

To measure model effectiveness, the following metrics were used:

_Accuracy:_ Overall correctness of predictions.

_Precision:_ Proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.

_Recall:_ Ability to identify all actual positives.

_F1-Score:_ Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced evaluation.

Additionally, feature importance analysis was conducted to identify which ad characteristics significantly influence the likelihood of a user clicking on the ad.
